As a results-driven Data Analyst with over three years of experience, I bring a unique blend of technical and communication skills to the table. My expertise includes customer research, competitor analysis, and inventory forecasting. I have applied these skills to optimize sales data and customer purchase behavior, resulting in a 30% increase in annual sales.

In my previous experience, I was fortunate to be part of the "Palent project", where I utilized data to promote equity in parenting education and support children in a world of technology disruption. This project earned me a full grant scholarship of $10,000 from the National Innovation Agency of the Thai government.

I am currently seeking new opportunities in the field of Data Analytics, where I can apply my strong analytical and technical skills. I have completed a Master's degree in Analytics with a focus on statistical modeling and machine learning at Northeastern University. My proficiency in R, SQL, Tableau, and Python, along with experience working with big data sets, make me a strong candidate for any data-focused role.

I am excited to bring my passion for problem-solving and data-driven decision making to a dynamic, fast-paced work environment. I am eager to contribute to the success of a company while growing my own skills and knowledge in this field.
